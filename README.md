## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

### What I learned

# Search bar 
**JavaScript code Demonstration**
To understand how this code works, let's break it down into smaller pieces:

The `searchInput` variable refers to the search input element in your HTML.

The `handleSearch()` function is defined as the event handler for the input event of the search `input` element. This means that the function will be called every time the user types something in the search input.

Inside the `handleSearch()` function, the search term entered by the user is retrieved from the `event.target.value` property and converted to lower case using the `toLowerCase()` method. This is done to make the search case-insensitive, so that it will match regardless of the case of the search term.

The `filteredCountries` array is created by using the `filter()` method on the `countries` array. The `filter()` method takes a callback function as an argument, which is called for each element in the array. The callback function returns `true` if the element should be included in the filtered array, and `false` if it should be excluded. In this case, the callback function checks if the search term is contained in either the `name` or `region` property of the country object, using the `includes()` method. The `name` and `region` values are also converted to lower case to make the search case-insensitive.

The `innerHTML` property of the `countriesCardCountainer` element is set to an empty string, which removes all existing cards from the container.

The filtered countries are displayed by using the `forEach()` method to iterate over the `filteredCountries` array, and the `append()` method to append the `element` property of each country object to the `countriesCardCountainer`.


```html

```
```css

```
```js
let countries = [] // it return from map that was applied on the API load response after it parse the value.

searchInput.addEventListener("input", handleSearch);

function handleSearch(event) {
  // Get the search term entered by the user
  const searchTerm = event.target.value.toLowerCase();

  // Filter the countries based on the search term
  const filteredCountries = countries.filter((country) => {
    return country.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm) ||
           country.region.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm);
  });

  // Clear the existing cards from the container
  countriesCardCountainer.innerHTML = "";

  // Display the filtered countries
  filteredCountries.forEach((country) => {
    countriesCardCountainer.append(country.element);
  });
}
```


### Continued development

-I still want to build the second page which will represent the information for an individual country by click on its card from the homepage.

-as well I must finish the part of filter by region task.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
